Aerosol and cloud sampling: Done in raytracing. Extra los points about 5\,m above and below cloud edges.

Sabines hint:\\
Generally transition layers are a nasty idea. They make physical interpretations much more complicated/difficult, e.g see \citet{Griessbach2013} and \citet{Hoepfner2009} scenarios 4 and 5 for the effects of transition layer sampling. I would strongly recommend to avoid transition layers as long as possible.

Anyway, real clouds usually have sharp cloud egdges (e.g. lifting condensation level).
