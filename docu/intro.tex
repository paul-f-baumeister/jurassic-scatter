The Juelich Rapid Spectral Simulation Code (JURASSIC) is a fast radiative transfer model for the mid-infrared spectral region \citep{Hoffmann2006}. It was used in several studies for the infrared limb sounder Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) \citep{Hoffmann2005, Hoffmann2008}, Cryogenic Infrared Spectrometers and Telescopes for the Atmosphere - New Frontiers (CRISTA-NF) \citep{Hoffmann2009, Weigel2010}, and Gimballed Limb Observer for Radiance Imaging of the Atmosphere (GLORIA) \citep{Ungermann2011a} and the nadir instrument Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) \citep{Hoffmann2009b, Grimsdell2010,Hoffmann2013}.

For fast simulations, it applies pre-calculated look-up tables of spectral emissivities and approximations to radiative transfer calculations, such as the emissivity growth approximation (EGA) \citep{Weinreb1973,Gordley1981,Marshall1994}.% and the Curtis-Godson approximation (CGA) \citep{Curtis1952,Godson1953}. 
The look-up-tables were calculated with the Reference Forward Model (RFM) \citep{Dudhia2002,Dudhia2014}, which is an exact line-by-line model specifically developed for MIPAS. For selected spectral windows, JURASSIC has been compared to the line-by-line models RFM and Karlsruhe Optimized and Precise Radiative transfer Algorithm (KOPRA) \citep{Stiller2000,Stiller2002,Hoepfner2005} and shows good agreement \citep{Griessbach2013}.

JURASSIC contains a scattering module that allows for radiative transfer simulations including single and multiple scattering on aerosol and cloud particles \citep{Griessbach2012,Griessbach2013}. Forward simulations with scattering on volcanic ash, ice and sulfate aerosol have been used to develop and characterise a volcanic ash detection method for MIPAS \citep{Griessbach2012a,Griessbach2014}.

Retrieval of large satellite data sets (e.g. AIRS) require plenty of computing time that can be provided by supercomputers. JURASSIC works on {JUROPA} and {JUQUEEN} at the J\"u{}lich Supercomputing Centre (JSC), Forschungszentrum J\"u{}lich GmbH \citep{Hoffmann2014}.
